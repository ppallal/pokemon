# Pokemon-NN
This is project is the final project for the class of ECE 285 ML for Image Processing.

The notebook Project.ipynb has all the code. 

Some things to change are - google collab specific cells. And cells for mounting the drive. 
Once all the data files and the folders are in the same directory we can start running the cells one by one. 
The first training parts are in this order
1. Auto encoder.
2. GAN with Auto Encoder
3. GAN with Generator
4. Classifier.

The subsequent metrics and image plots are right after the training cells of each category mentioned above.

Recomended usage -> Train the autoencoder first. and then train any other section.

If you want to lead the classifier's pretrained net use ```class3.net```.


_Also If someone refers to this in the future, Please leave a comment, I will feel happy :P_

However the data files and the pretrained models can be found here:
