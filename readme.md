# Pokemon-NN
This is project is the final project for the class of ECE 285 ML for Image Processing.

The notebook Project.ipynb has all the code. 

### Recomended usage
Some things to change are
* google collab specific cells (installs etc)
* And cells for mounting the drive. 

Once all the data files and the folders are in the same directory we can start running the cells one by one. 

Run all the cells until the first training part marked as training autoencoder.

The training parts are in this order
1. Auto encoder.
2. GAN with Auto Encoder
3. GAN with Generator
4. Classifier.
The subsequent metrics and image plots are right after the training cells of each category mentioned above.

Train the autoencoder first, then train any other section.
If you want to load the pretrained net use ```class3.net```.

### Data
However the data files and the pretrained models can be found here:
